## Example

Ask the jellyfish expert:
> Can you briefly explain the reproduction of jellyfish? If information is not contained in the document, skip the question, and explain something you do know. Do not say what information is or is not contained in the document provided. Keep your response concise, and less than 100 words.

Expert response:
> "Jellyfish reproduction is fascinating! They have a two-stage life cycle: the polyp stage and the medusa stage. In the polyp stage, they can reproduce asexually by budding, which is like cloning. However, when they are mature jellyfish, or medusae, they reproduce sexually by releasing eggs and sperm into the water to create larval jellyfish called planulae. These planulae then settle on a surface and grow into new polyps, starting the cycle all over again. Nature's pretty amazing, right?"

## Motivation
I enjoy watching YouTube videos, so I wanted to create my own using AI. YouTube is a large platform where a single video could be seen by thousands of people. My long term goal is to have a number of different channels that promote charities. I can quickly generate a high volume of content with the purpose of raising money to help solve important issues. For this initial video I have added in the description a link to a charity to help reduce harm caused to animals in the wild.
