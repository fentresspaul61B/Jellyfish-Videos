0,"Can you briefly explain the endangered status of jellyfish? If information is not contained in the document, skip the question, and explain something you do know. Do not say what information is or is not contained in the document provided. Keep your response concise, and less than 150 words.","Jellyfish are not universally endangered, but certain species face threats due to environmental changes. For example, the Irukandji jellyfish (Carukia barnesi) is considered vulnerable in some areas due to water pollution and habitat loss. Factors contributing to the vulnerability of some jellyfish include ocean warming, which can disrupt their life cycles, and ocean acidification, which affects the availability of their prey. On the other hand, some jellyfish populations are booming, leading to issues like clogging fishing nets and cooling intakes at power plants. These ""blooms"" are often attributed to decreased predation and increased nutrients in the water from agricultural runoff. Thus, the status varies significantly by species and location.",756,109,"System: You are a helpful assistant who creates youtube video titles.

Keep your response concise, and less than 150 words.","Jellyfish are found in every ocean of the world, from the surface to the deep sea. They thrive in various habitats including open oceans, coastal areas, and even some freshwater bodies. Some species, such as the moon jellyfish (Aurelia aurita), are common in coastal and temperate waters, while others like the deep-sea dwelling Periphylla periphylla inhabit the dark depths of the ocean. Jellyfish adapt to a wide range of conditions, from warm tropical waters to the frigid waters of the Arctic and Antarctic. This variability in habitat is accompanied by their ability to tolerate various salinities and temperatures, demonstrating their highly adaptable nature in marine environments.",688,106,"System: You are a helpful assistant who creates youtube video titles.
